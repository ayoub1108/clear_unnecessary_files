Code Breakdown
@echo off
 - This command disables the display of commands in the command prompt. When you run the batch file, it won't show each command before executing it.
cd/
- This command changes the current directory to the root of the drive (C:\ if you are on the C: drive). The / specifies the root.
@echo

-This command outputs a blank line to the command prompt. It's used to create a visual separation or a pause between the previous command and the next output.
del *.log /a /s /q /f

-This command deletes all files with a .log extension in the current directory and all subdirectories. Here's what each switch means:
*.log: Specifies that all files with the .log extension should be deleted.
/a: This switch allows deletion of files with specified attributes. However, in this context, it does not specify any attributes, so it acts as a general delete.
/s: This switch tells the command to delete files from all subdirectories as well.
/q: This stands for "quiet mode" and suppresses confirmation prompts. The deletion occurs without asking the user for confirmation.
/f: This forces deletion of read-only files, if any.
pause

This command causes the script to wait for the user to press any key before continuing. This is useful for allowing the user to see any output or confirmation messages before the command prompt window closes.
